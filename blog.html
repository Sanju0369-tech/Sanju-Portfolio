    <h1>Expert Answers: Website Design & SEO Insights</h1>
    <div class="faq">
      <h2>1. What is the best website design company?</h2>
      <img src="banner1.webp" alt="Best Website Design Company in Bawana">
      <p>There’s no single “best” website design company that fits everyone — the ideal choice depends on your goals, budget, and style. However, I can share what to look for and suggest a few...</p>
      <p>When choosing a website design company, prioritize three things:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Strategic thinking (not just aesthetics)</li>
        <li>Mobile and SEO optimization</li>
        <li>Conversion-focused design</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Many top-tier agencies deliver visually impressive sites, but fail to integrate marketing, performance, and lead generation. That’s where boutique or freelancer-led teams often provide better results...</p>
      <p>For instance, I’ve worked with clients across industries to develop custom websites that blend clean UX with strong branding and performance. If you're looking for a blend of design, development, and business strategy, consider agencies with proven results...</p>
      <p>Additionally, good agencies should offer more than just design. Services like SEO, social media marketing, and paid ads help ensure your site not only looks great — but also brings real traffic and leads...</p>
      <p>For those who prefer working with a dedicated professional rather than a large agency, platforms like Dribbble, Upwork, or even reaching out directly through a freelancer's site can be effective...</p>
      <p>In summary, the "best" website design company is the one that understands your brand, goals, and audience. Whether you choose a large firm or a freelancer-led team, focus on value, communication, and long-term growth.</p>

      <h2>3. Why is SEO important for local businesses in Delhi?</h2>
      <img src="seo.webp" alt="SEO Services in Bawana, Delhi">

    <div class="faq">
      <h2>4. Freelancer or Agency: Which is better for website design?</h2>
      <img src="about.webp" alt="Freelance Website Developer in Bawana">
      <p>If you’re a startup or local service provider, working with a freelancer can be cost-effective and flexible. Agencies have larger teams and more structured workflows but may charge higher prices.</p>
      <p>As a freelancer, I offer personalized service, quick turnaround, and multi-skill support (design + SEO + marketing). Choose based on your goals — but always ask for a portfolio, testimonials, and clear deliverables.</p>
